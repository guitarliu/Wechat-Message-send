## BackGround
Once upon a time, I need to send wechat messages to someone or some chatrooms schedulely, in order to remind what they need to do at specific time. But I find nothing except the first script---[定时提醒](https://github.com/guitarliu/Wechat-Message-send/blob/master/定时提醒.py). It seems complex and also poorly understood with extra a ".xlsx" file for me. So I'm keeping finding some wheels which are easily to operate and use. And then schedule module have been found. Easy to be understood, few codes and so on as we see. I even make up a tiny software to remind me to have lunch or dinner early!(Someone may say "You can sest an alarm"; But I am sure that you all know the words "Nei Juan"). With the software, my computer locks off at specific time schedulely. At that time, I realise it's lunch or dinner time. This is helpful to me!
